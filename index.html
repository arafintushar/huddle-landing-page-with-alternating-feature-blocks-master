              Huddle re-imagines the way we build communities. You have a voice,
              but so does your audience. Create connections with your users as
              you engage in genuine discussion.

    Grow Together
    <br />
    Generate meaningful discussions with your audience and build a strong, loyal
    community. Think of the insightful conversations you miss out on with a
    feedback form.
    <br />
    Flowing Conversations
    <br />
    You wouldn't paginate a conversation in real life, so why do it online? Our
    threads have just-in-time loading for a more natural flow.
    <br />

    <br />
    It takes no time at all to integrate Huddle with your app's authentication
